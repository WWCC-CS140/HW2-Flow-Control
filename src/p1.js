// Write a program that calculates the number of roots a quadratic equation will have
// The program should return a 2, 1, or 0 based on how many roots the equation has
// A quadratic formula has:
//   two roots when its discriminant is positive
//   one root when its discriminant is zero
//   zero roots when its discriminant is negative 
function p1(a, b, c) {
